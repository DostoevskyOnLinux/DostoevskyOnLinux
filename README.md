## Hi, I’m @DostoevskyOnLinux

I'm a CS student in East Texas interested in Android development, 
Linux system administration, and a happy user of the Plasma DE.

I'm looking to spend my summer learning from and maybe even contributing
to some of my favorite open-source projects. Please drop me a message on 
Mastodon at @codrusofathens@linuxrocks.online if you have tips or suggestions!
